# Mapping Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this activity is to map recent earthquake data on an interactive map with different map background layers, and options for viewing alternative Earthquake data.  In this challenge, we were asked to add two map objects to toggle on and off:
- All earthquakes in the last 7 days
- Major earthquakes in the last 7 days

I chose, instead to create a map object of all earthquakes in the last 7 days, and significant earthquakes in the last 30 days.  Both of those geoJSON files were pulled from the USGS Earthquake website.
